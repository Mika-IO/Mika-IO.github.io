    <h2>Rust vs Python</h2>

    <p data-aos="fade-down">
      Rust and Python are distinct programming languages with varying priorities
      and use cases. Rust prioritizes performance and safety, while Python
      prioritizes ease of use and flexibility.
    </p>
    <h3>FFI: Foreign Function Interface</h3>
    <p data-aos="fade-down">
      A Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is a mechanism that allows programming
      languages to interoperate with each other by calling functions and using
      data structures across language boundaries. It provides a way for
      developers to combine the strengths of multiple programming languages in a
      single application or project. In this article, we will explore the
      concept of FFI and compare the usage of FFI in two popular programming
      languages: Rust and Python.
    </p>
    <h3>Using Rust in python</h3>
    <p data-aos="fade-down">
      Using FFI (Foreign Function Interface) with Rust and Python offers several
      benefits. In the case of Rust, leveraging FFI allows developers to tap
      into existing libraries and APIs written in other languages, such as C or
      C++. This capability enables Rust to access a vast ecosystem of
      pre-existing code, making it easier to integrate with systems or utilize
      specialized functionalities. Additionally, Rust's FFI features ensure
      safety and efficiency when interacting with foreign code, thanks to its
      strong static typing and memory safety guarantees. On the other hand,
      Python's FFI capabilities open up doors to harnessing the power of
      languages like C, C++, or Rust within a Python codebase. By integrating
      these languages through FFI, Python developers can access high-performance
      libraries, low-level functionality, or even leverage Rust's safety
      features for critical components of their applications. This combination
      enhances Python's versatility, allowing it to excel in areas such as
      scientific computing, data analysis, and performance-critical tasks.
      Overall, FFI provides a bridge between Rust and Python, enabling
      developers to leverage the unique strengths of each language. Rust's FFI
      empowers developers with safe and efficient access to existing libraries,
      while Python's FFI facilitates seamless integration of performant and
      specialized code. Together, FFI and these two languages offer a powerful
      combination for building robust, efficient, and flexible applications.
